            <h2># Diode</h2>
            <p>
                Diodes are used to protect circuits by limiting the voltage and to also transform AC into DC.
                Semiconductors like silicon and germanium are used to make the most of the diodes. Even though they
                transmit current in a single direction, the way with which they transmit differs. There are different
                kinds of diodes and each type has its own applications.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Diode Symbol</h3>
            <img src="./images/diodes-symbol.png" alt="">
            <p>
                A standard diode symbol is represented as above. In the above diagram, we can see that there are two
                terminals that are known as anode and cathode. The arrowhead is the anode that represents the direction
                of the conventional current flow in the forward biased condition. The other end is the cathode.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Diode Construction</h3>
            <p>
                Diodes can be made of either of the two semiconductor materials, silicon and germanium. When the anode
                voltage is more positive than the cathode voltage, the diode is said to be forward-biased, and it
                conducts readily with a relatively low-voltage drop. Likewise, when the cathode voltage is more positive
                than the anode, the diode is said to be reverse-biased. The arrow in the diode symbol represents the
                direction of conventional current flow when the diode conducts.

            <h3>Light Emitting Diode (LED)</h3>
            <p>
                When an electric current between the electrodes passes through this diode, light is produced. In other
                words,
                light is generated when a sufficient amount of forwarding current passes through it. In many diodes,
                this
                light generated is not visible as there are frequency levels that do not allow visibility. LEDs are
                available in different colours. There are tricolour LEDs that can emit three colours at a time. Light
                colour
                depends on the energy gap of the semiconductor used.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Laser Diode</h3>
            <p>
                It is a different type of diode as it produces coherent light. It is highly used in CD drives, DVDs and
                laser
                devices. These are costly when compared to LEDs and are cheaper when compared to other laser generators.
                Limited life is the only drawback of these diodes.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Avalanche Diode</h3>
            <p>
                This diode belongs to a reverse bias type and operates using the avalanche effect. When voltage drop is
                constant and is independent of current, the breakdown of avalanche takes place. They exhibit high levels
                of
                sensitivity and hence are used for photo detection.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Zener Diode</h3>
            <p>
                It is the most useful type of diode as it can provide a stable reference voltage. These are operated in
                reverse bias and break down on the arrival of a certain voltage. If current passing through the resistor
                is
                limited, a stable voltage is generated. Zener diodes are widely used in power supplies to provide a
                reference voltage.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Schottky Diode</h3>
            <p>
                It has a lower forward voltage than other silicon PN junction diodes. The drop will be seen where there
                is
                low current and at that stage, voltage ranges between 0.15 and 0.4 volts. These are constructed
                differently
                in order to obtain that performance. Schottky diodes are highly used in rectifier applications.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Photodiode</h3>
            <p>
                A photo-diode can identify even a small amount of current flow resulting from the light. These are very
                helpful in the detection of the light. This is a reverse bias diode and used in solar cells and
                photometers.
                They are even used to generate electricity.

            <h3>P-N Junction Diode</h3>
            <p>
                The P-N junction diode is also known as rectifier diodes. These diodes are used for the rectification
                process
                and are made up of semiconductor material. The P-N junction diode includes two layers of semiconductors.
                One
                layer of the semiconductor material is doped with P-type material and the other layer with N-type
                material.
                The combination of these both P and N-type layers form a junction known as the P-N junction. Hence, the
                name
                P-N junction diode.
            </p>
            <p>
                P-N junction diode allows the current to flow in the forward direction and blocks the flow of current in
                the
                reverse direction.

            <h3>Forward-biased Diode</h3>
            <p>
                There is a small drop of voltage across the diode when the diode is forward-biased and the current is
                conducting. For silicon diodes, the forward voltage is 690mV and for germanium, 300mV is the forward
                voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The potential energy across the p-type material is positive and across the n-type material, the
                potential
                energy is negative.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Reverse-biased Diode</h3>
            <p>
                A diode is said to be reverse-biased when the battery’s voltage is dropped completely. For silicon
                diodes,
                the reverse current is -20μA and for germanium, -50μA is the reverse current. The potential energy
                across
                the p-type material is negative and across the n-type material, the potential energy is positive.
            </p>

            <h3>Zero-biased Diode</h3>
            <p>When the diode is zero-biased, the voltage potential across the diode is zero.</p>

            <h2># Transistor</h2>
            <p>
                A transistor Is a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition
                amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch/gate for them. Typically,
                transistors consist of three layers, or terminals, of a semiconductor material, each of whichh can carry
                a current.
            </p>
            <p>
                When working as an amplifier, a transistor transforms a small input current into a bigger output
                current.
                As a switch, It can be in one of two distinct states – on or off – to control the flow of electronic
                signals through an electrical circuit or electronic device .
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Why transistors are important</h3>
            <p>
                On its own, a transistor has only one circuit element. In small quantities, transistors are used to
                create simple electronic switches. They are the basic elements in integrated circuits (ICs), which
                consist of a large number of transistors interconnected with circuitry and baked into a single silicon
                microchip.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                In large numbers, transistors are used to create microprocessors where millions of transistors are
                embedded into a single IC. They also drive computer memory chips and memory storage devices for MP3
                players, smartphones, cameras and electronic games. Transistors are deeply embedded in nearly all ICs,
                which are part of every electronic device.
            </p>
            <p>
                Transistors are also used for low-frequency, high-power applications, such as power-supply inverters
                that
                convert alternating current into direct current. Additionally, transistors are used in high-frequency
                applications, such as the oscillator circuits used to generate radio signals.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>How transistors work</h3>
            <p>
                A transistor can act as a switch or gate for electronic signals, opening and closing an electronic gate
                many times per second. It ensures the circuit is on if the current is flowing and switched off if it
                isn't. Transistors are used in complex switching circuits that comprise all modern telecommunications
                systems. Circuits also offer very high switching speeds, such as hundreds of gigahertz or more than 100
                billion on-and-off cycles per second.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                Transistors can be combined to form a logic gate, which compares multiple input currents to provide a
                different output. Computers with logic gates can make simple decisions using Boolean algebra. These
                techniques are the foundation of modern-day computing and computer programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Transistors also play an important role in amplifying electronic signals. For example, in radio
                applications, like FM receivers, where the received electrical signal may be weak due to disturbances,
                amplification is required to provide audible output. Transistors provide this amplification by
                increasing the signal strength.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Types of transistors</h3>
            <p>Transistors are classified into two major types:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)</li>
                <li>Field-effect transistor (FET)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                A field-effect transistor (FET) also has three terminals -- source, drain and gate -- which are
                analogous
                to BJT's emitter, collector and base, respectively. In the FET, the n-type and p-type silicon layers are
                arranged differently from those of the BJT. They are also coated with layers of metal and oxide to
                create the metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET).
            </p>

            <p>
                In the FET, field effect refers to an effect that enables the flow of current and switches the
                transistor on. Electrons can't flow from the n-type source to the drain because the p-type gate between
                them contains holes. But attaching a positive voltage to the gate creates an electric field that enables
                electrons to flow from the source to the drain. This creates the field effect, which facilitates the
                flow of current in the FET.
            </p>

            <p>
                FETs are commonly used in low-noise amplifiers, buffer amplifiers and analog switches. The
                metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor.

            <h2># Inductors and Capacitors</h2>
            <p>
                We introduce here the two basic circuit elements we have not considered so far: the inductor and the
                capacitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inductors and capacitors are energy storage devices, which means energy can be stored in them. But they
                cannot generate energy, so these are passive devices. The inductor stores energy in its magnetic field;
                the capacitor stores energy in its electric field.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>A Bit of Physics</h3>
            <p>
                The behavior of the inductor is based on the properties of the magnetic field generated in a coil of
                wire. In fact, the inductor is basically a coil of wire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ampere’s Law: current in a coil ⇒ magnetic field
            </p>
            <p>
                Faraday’s Law: Time-varying magnetic field ⇒ induced voltage (emf)
            </p>
            <p>
                In circuits that we will study, the time-varying magnetic field is produced by a changing current.
            </p>
            <p>
                The behavior of the capacitor is based on the properties of the electric field created in a dielectric
                (non-conductor) placed between two conductors. The capacitor is basically a non-conductor sandwiched
                between two conductors.

            <p>
                An inductor is a passive electronic component that temporarily stores energy in a magnetic field when
                electric current
                flows through the inductor's coil

                The relationship between current and voltage involves the time derivative of the current. This is
                because a changing current produces a changing magnetic field, which induces a voltage.

                Any physical device that involves a coil of wire can be modeled using inductance. An obvious example is
                a motor, whose windings have an inductance. More generally, a device with a current-induced magnetic
                field that interacts like an inductor will have inductance.

                    V = L × (di/dt) ⇒ if current is constant (NOT necessarily 0), there is no voltage. In other words,

            <h3>Current in terms of voltage</h3>
            <p>
                The current-voltage relationship we discussed above tells us the inductor voltage if we know the
                inductor current. But sometimes we have the inductor voltage and need to find the current, so we need to
                integrate…
            </p>
            <p>i = (1/L) <sup>T</sup>&int;<sub>0</sub> v.dt + i<sub>0</sub></p>
            <p>
                We have integrated the voltage from an “initial” time t<sub>0</sub> to the “final” time t (which is
                arbitrary). If
                we know the value of the current at the initial time t<sub>0</sub>, we can find the current as a
                function of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current-voltage relationship is a first-order differential equation for the current
                i<sub>L</sub>(t). To solve
                it (meaning that we find a numerical expression for the current as a function of time) we need to know
                the initial condition iL(t<sub>0</sub>). This will be given, or there will be a way to find it.

                delivered to/from it. In what follows we assume passive sign convention. Here’s the analysis.

            <h2>The Capacitor</h2>
            <p>
                A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field by virtue of accumulating
                electric charges on two close surfaces insulated from each other. It is a passive electronic component
                with two terminals.

            <p>
                We can make a capacitor by sandwiching an insulator between two conductors. The conductors can be metal
                or metallic foil, as is often used in construction of capacitors used for discrete circuit elements in
                the lab. It can also be an insulating material between two semiconductors, or between a metal and a
                semiconductor, as it is in integrated circuits.

                Any physical device that involves conducting plates or wires with insulation between them (note that air
                is an insulator) can be modeled using capacitance. Two wires stranded together that connect two devices
                will have capacitance. Semiconductor devices made from some combination of metal and semiconductor
                layers have capacitance.

            <h2># LC Circuit</h2>
            <p>
                Most induction heating systems make use of an electric circuit which has very low impedance at a certain
                frequency. This circuit is called "Resonance circuit", is often built using passive circuit elements; an
                inductor, such as a coil, connected (in parallel or series) to a capacitor. Resonance circuits are
                called tuned circuits or tank circuits The term "tank" is derived from the fact that the capacitor and
                inductor both serve as storage-tank-type devices for energy, electrostatic in nature for the capacitor
                and electromagnetic in the case of the inductor. The action is like a tuned action, mathematically known
                as a harmonic oscillator, which is similar to a pendulum swinging back and forth, so the circuit is
                called tuned circuit. The response of the circuit to signals of different frequencies is a function of
                the inductance and capacitance of the circuit.

            <h3>Mechanism of Energy conversion between capacitor and inductor</h3>
            <p>
                Let’s take a capacitor with capacitance C and an inductor with inductance L. The capacitor is fully
                charged with charge Qo. What we do here is to connect the capacitor and the inductor end to end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming the inductor and capacitor to be ideal (meaning resistance will be zero in the overall
                circuit). Initially, the capacitor C of the LC circuit carries a charge Qo and current I in the Inductor
                is zero. Therefore at time T = 0, the charge on the capacitor will be:
            </p>
            <p>
                Q(T=0) = Q<sub>o</sub> => Current Flowing: I = 0
            </p>
            <p>
                Then all the energy of the circuit is initially stored in the electric field of the capacitor This
                energy is U<sub>c</sub> = (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) (<sup>q<sup>2</sup></sup>/<sub>c</sub>)
            </p>
            <p>
                At time T = t, the capacitor now begins to discharge through the inductor. The current begins to flow .
                Therefore the charge of the capacitor decreases, but the energy of the inductor increases. The energy
                gets transferred from the capacitor to the inductor. Then the relationship between the current and the
                charge will be: I = - (<sup>dq</sup>/<sub>dt</sub>)
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                The negative sign Is added because as the time passes from 0 to t the, charge on the plates of capacitor
                decreases i.e. charge decreases with respect to time and thus the dq/dt obtained will be negative and
                this is why we add a negative sign to make a current positive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current, in turn, creates a magnetic field in the inductor. The net effect of this process is a
                transfer of energy from the capacitor, with its diminishing electric field, to the inductor, with its
                increasing magnetic field. the capacitor is completely discharged and all the energy is stored in the
                magnetic field of the inductor. At this instant, the current is at its maximum value Imax and the energy
                in the inductor is
            </p>
            <p>U<sub>L</sub> = (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) L . I<sub>max</sub><sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>
                Since there is no resistance in the circuit, no energy is lost through Joule heating; thus, the maximum
                energy stored in the capacitor is equal to the maximum energy stored at a later time in the inductor:
            </p>
            <p>
                (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) <sup>q<sup>2</sup></sup>/<sub>c</sub> = (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) L .
                I<sub>max</sub><sup>2</sup>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                an arbitrary time when the capacitor charge is q(t) and the current is i(t), the total energy U in the
                circuit is given by
            </p>
            <p>
                U = (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) <sup>q<sup>2</sup>(t)</sup>/<sub>c</sub> + (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) L
                .
                I<sup>2</sup>(t)
            </p>

            <p>
                Because there is no energy dissipation in ideal form
            </p>
            <p>
                U = (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) <sup>q<sup>2</sup>(t)</sup>/<sub>c</sub> + (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) L
                .
                I<sup>2</sup>(t) = (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) <sup>q<sup>2</sup>(t)</sup>/<sub>c</sub> =
                (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) L .
                I<sup>2</sup>(t)
            </p>

            <p>
                After reaching its maximum I max, the current i(t) continues to transport charge between the capacitor
                plates, thereby recharging the capacitor. Since the inductor resists a change in current, current
                continues to flow, even though the capacitor is discharged. This continued current causes the capacitor
                to charge with opposite polarity. The electric field of the capacitor increases while the magnetic field
                of the inductor diminishes, and the overall effect is a transfer of energy from the inductor back to the
                capacitor. From the law of energy conservation, the maximum charge that the capacitor re-acquires is q°.
                However the capacitor plates are charged opposite to what they were initially.

        <section>
            <p>
                When fully charged, the capacitor once again transfers its energy to the inductor until it is again
                completely discharged, in the last part of this cyclic process, energy flows back to the capacitor, and
                the initial state of the circuit is restored. This process is shown as

            <h3>Damping in LC Circuit</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the absence of a resistor in the ideal form of the circuit, an LC circuit consumes no energy.
                This is unlike the ideal forms of RC circuits, RL circuits, or RLC circuits, which consume energy due to
                the presence of a resistor, in a practical circuit, an LC circuit will always consume some energy
                because of the non-zero resistance of the components and connecting wires. This means that The charge
                flows back and forth between the plates of the capacitor and through the inductor. So The energy
                oscillates between a capacitor and an inductor until the internal resistance of the components and
                connecting wires makes the oscillations die out. The oscillations are then said to be “damped” with the
                amount of damping being determined by the quality or Q-factor of the circuit The ratio of inductive
                reactance to the resistance of the circuit is sometimes called the quality factor, or Q
            </p>
            <p>
                (Q= XL/R = 2πfL/R), which Offers a comparison between the total energy in a tuned circuit and the energy
                dissipated by the resistance in a circuit.

                To ensure that the signal will not die out, It is a must to use an AC power supply.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are essentially six different types of power supplies for induction heating applications, each
                designed to supply ac power within a given fre- quency range. These six types are line-frequency
                supplies, frequency mul- tipliers, motor-generators, solid-state (static) inverters, spark-gap
                converters, and radio-frequency (RF) power supplies. At the present time, the spark-gap oscillator is no
                longer in use, and the solid-state power supply has all but replaced the motor-generator. The ranges of
                frequencies and power ratings presently available are summarized in the following Fig.

            <h2># Magnetic Classification of Materials</h2>
            <p>
                There are various kinds of magnetism, out of which ferromagnetism is the strongest type. Ferromagnetic
                materials are those materials which exhibit a spontaneous net magnetization at the atomic level, even in
                the absence of an external magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p>
                When placed in an external magnetic field, ferromagnetic materials are strongly magnetized in the
                direction of the field. Ferromagnetic materials are strongly attracted to a magnet. These materials will
                retain their magnetization for some time even after the external magnetizing field is removed. This
                property is called hysteresis.
            </p>

            <div class="vertical-margin-2"></div>
            <h3>Causes of Ferromagnetism</h3>

                are aligned in the same direction. The domains exhibit a net magnetic moment even in the absence of an
                external magnetizing field.

                However, the magnetic moments of neighbouring domains are oriented in opposite directions. They cancel
                out and therefore the net magnetic moment of the material is zero. On applying external magnetic field
                these domains all align themselves in the direction of the applied field. In this way, the material is
                strongly magnetized in a direction parallel to the magnetizing field.

            <h3>Paramagnetism</h3>
            <p>
                Paramagnetism is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material, so most atoms with
                incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic, although exceptions such as copper exist. Due to
                their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act like tiny magnets. An external
                magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction.
                Paramagnetic materials include aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron oxide (FeO). Therefore, a simple
                rule of thumb is used in chemistry to determine whether a particle (atom, ion, or molecule) is
                paramagnetic or diamagnetic:[3] if all electrons in the particle are paired, then the substance made of
                this particle is diamagnetic; if it has unpaired electrons, then the substance is paramagnetic.

                Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied
                magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials
                retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. in
                the absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is
                removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a
                small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field
                strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials
                is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between
                a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.

            <h3>Diamagnetism</h3>
            <p>
                Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced
                magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic
                and ferromagnetic materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical
                effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is
                called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, the weak diamagnetic force is overcome
                by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic
                materials is less than the permeability of vacuum, μ0. In most materials, diamagnetism is a weak effect
                which can be detected only by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong
                diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.

            <p>
                A magnetic field is an invisible force field created by a magnet or as a consequence of the movement of
                electric charges (flow of electricity).
            </p>
            <p>
                The magnitude (intensity) of a magnetic field is usually measured Tesla (T or in mT), but it can also be
                measured in Gauss (G).
            </p>
            <p>
                A magnetic field can be generated by conducting an electric current in a wire, a circular coil, or a
                spiral coil.

                to the wire, and increases if the current increases.

                <li>
                    The magnitude of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the magnitude of current through the
                    loop B α I. Therefore, the higher the current passed through the circular wire, the more iron
                    filings align with the magnetic field circular line indicating an increase in the intensity of the
                    magnetic field on increasing the current.

                    The magnitude of the magnetic field is inversely Proportional to the radius of the circular loop B α
                    1 / r. Thus, when the radius of the circular loop is increased, less number of iron filings are
                    aligned in the direction of the magnetic field, this indicates that with an increase in the radius
                    of the circular wire conductor, the intensity of the magnetic field decreases.

                Induction heating is a process for heating metals and other electrically conductive materials that is
                precise repeatable and a safe non-contact method.
            </p>
            <p>
                it involves a complex combination of electromagnetic energy and heat transfer that passes through an
                induction coil creating an electromagnetic field within the coil to metal down materials.
            </p>

            <h3>Faraday's law of induction</h3>
            <p>
                when an electrically conducting material ( such as a metal) is placed within a time-varying magnetic
                field, an electric current (called «eddy current») is induced in the part producing a second magnetic
                field which opposes the applied field. The reason behind this phenomenon is that a time-varying magnetic
                field disturbs the relaxed environmental condition of the electrically conducting material. in return,
                the material tries to oppose this change by producing another magnetic field to cancel the imposed field

            <h3>How does induction heating work?</h3>
            <p>
                Induction phenomenon has two important consequences:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Induced Force:- when a permanent magnet is dropped into a copper tube, the induced force according
                    to Faraday's law tries to stop the magnet's motion inside the tube.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Induced Heat:- when an electrically conductive material is exposed to an alternating magnetic field,
                    depending on the material, heat is induced by two mechanisms ( Joule heating and magnetic
                    Hysteresis) . The latter occurs in the magnetic metals (such as carbon steel below curie
                    temperature) in which the rotation of the adjacent magnetic dipoles due to the direction change of
                    the imposed magnetic field will lead into friction and heat , this effect increases by increasing
                    the frequency of the imposed magnetic field.

        <section>
            <img style="width:70%;" src="./images/heating-3.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>
                Joule heating:- is the main heat effect caused by induction phenomenon. any current i.e ac or dc ,
                passes through an electrically conducting material causes voltage drop V resulting in energy conversion
                to heat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heat power is defined by VI = RI^2 , where R is the electrical resistance of the current path is
                inversely proportional to the cross -section area in which the current is flowing.

            <h3>How is the induced heat generated?</h3>
            <p>
                If an electrically conducting material is exposed to a magnetic field, eddy current are induced in the
                material. Special characteristics of such currents result in a phenomenon which we call "induction heat"
                . The eddy currents are concerned at the surface of the material, the reason is that at high frequency,
                the imposed magnetic field changes it's direction very fast. Therefore, the induced current in one
                direction don't have enough time to penetrate into the depth of the metal before their time is up. The
                thickness of the current penetration in the material is called "skin depth" . Skin depth depends on the
                electromagnetic properties of the material and also is inversely proportional to the frequency.

                Using high frequencies in induction heating industry ( mainly 10kHz to 700kHz) implies very thin
                penetration depth in metals (typically less than 1mm). Passing high current density (big 1) through that
                shallow depth (big R) results in high RI^2 . Consequently, high energy conversion from electrical to
                heat occurs.

            <h3>Eddy currents</h3>
            <p>
                Eddy currents are loops of electrical current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field in
                the conductor according to the Faraday's law of induction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eddy currents flow in closed loops within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eddy currents -based methods measure a material's response to electromagnetic field over a specific
                frequency range, typically a few Hz to several MHz

                The principal of any EC(eddy current) is a magnetic coil with alternating current induces a time-varying
                magnetic field that causes an electric current to be generated in the test object.
            </p>
            <p>
                These currents produce small magnetic field around the material which, by opposing the original field,
                change the impedance of the magnetic coil.
